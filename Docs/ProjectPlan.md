Version 2: updated task allocation

## 1 Introduction

This is an application of a simple word game, where player find words in a letter grid. Past game and word performance are provided as well.

## 2 Process Description

- Inception
  - Description: In this phase, we will read the requirements presented, clarify doubts with stakeholder, generate our first UML diagram, and come up with a timeline for project.
  - Entrance criteria: Requirement documents presented by stakeholder
  - Exit criteria: All team member fully understand the requirements, agree on UML diagram and agree on project timeline.
  
- Elaboration
  - Description: In this phase, we will generate documents, in much more details, for functional and non-functional requirements. This includes our Design documents, Test plan documents and Use-case documents.
  - Entrance criteria: Further ducuments needed from stakeholder, and UML diagram from previous phase
  - Exit criteria: All documents are throughly discussed within the team and stakeholder. Documents include a refined project plan, a detailed use-case model, a design document, and a plan for testing.
  
- Construction  
  - Description: In this phase, we will actually construct the application per requirement. During the development process, documents from previous phases could be updated (version update required), but they should be kept as static in general. We will do thorough black-box testing and white-box testing as per requirement as well.
  - Entrance criteria: Ready documents from previous phases
  - Exit criteria: a workable version of app (prototype) with preliminary testing
  
- Transition
  - Description: In this phase, we further perfect our app with enhanced testing, as well as refined documentation
  - Entrance criteria: prototype app, some testing cases
  - Exit criteria: Fully polished application, with full testing done. A full set of documentation should be ready and signed off as well.
